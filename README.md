# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection

## Overview

This repository hosts a collection of Jupyter notebooks focusing on various topics within anomaly detection, inter-rater reliability measurement, visualization, and data preprocessing. 
These notebooks delve into specific concepts such as Cohen's Kappa for inter-rater agreement, contamination factor in anomaly detection, ECO visualization techniques, LEAD buildings extraction, 
Krippendorff's Alpha for reliability assessment, implementation of Isolation Forest using Pycaret, and a voting method for reliability measurement.
Each notebook provides implementations related to its respective subject.
